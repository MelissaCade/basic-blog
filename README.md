## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a simple blog page. A user can write a blog post and have it published to the blog. A username, title, and post are necessary input. Once the "post" button is pressed, the user is redirected to the blog page, where their entries are shown. Users can use the "back" button on the blog page to get back to the form page. Users can also toggle back and forth between light and dark modes.
